Introducing: PowerSET!
======================

PowerSET (Powershell Social Engineering Toolkit)~Used for many deceitful things… Windows Powershell: 1:Is an extremely powerful front-end for the well known Microsoft .Net Framework 2:Uses an Object Pipeline making data processing fast and easy 3:Excels in network administration(any Windows sysadmin worth his beans uses it :P) 4:Is installed on all computers WinServer2008 and up

Using these facts we can conclude that with all this power and ease of use, exploitation is as easy as pie. One form of exploitation i have yet to see is the use of Powershell for social engineering attacks. Well the time has come for someone to do something about that…
